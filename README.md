# VineVolumeFixer
A simple addon for firefox & chrome that sets vine.co videos to a sane level.

Vine.co videos play way too loud and don't have volume control.

This add-on adjusts vine video volume to a sane level of your choosing.
It also (optionally) adds a volume control & un-mutes the video when playback starts.
